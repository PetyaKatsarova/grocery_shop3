## Grocery Shop
This is the backend code for functionality of a simple e-commerce grocery shop. There are 3 main items you can buy: Bread, Beer and Vegetables. There are default prices but you can change them,
as well. We are a cool shop, so we have all the time discounts :) We start with default discounts. Once the project is complete you would be able to change the values of those through an API call. 
For changing the logic of the discounts, need to quickly write a back end function. Here you wiil find mainly the logic and API calls. No payment method solutions added.
